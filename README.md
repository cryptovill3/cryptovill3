### Hello everyone 🌟

Welcome to my repository! This is where I document my learning journey, including all the projects I'm tackling along the way.

- 🚀 I’m currently working through cloud engineering concepts via [LearntoCloud.guide](https://learntocloud.guide) and focusing on the hands-on projects that come with the course.
- My aim is to become highly proficient in **Linux** and the **Cloud stack**, particularly in **Cloud Engineering**, **DevOps**, and **Infrastructure Automation**.
- 📚 I’m also currently reading *Linux Command Line* by Shotts to deepen my understanding of Linux.
